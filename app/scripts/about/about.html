John Daly started his working days with Dawson’s of Mount Southwell who had a stone cutting business at the Railway Station Yard. It was here that he learned his trade as a stone cutter and stayed with Dawson’s until the mid-1930’s.

John was now an accomplished Craftsman and Sculptor and so when Dawson’s decide to close, John set up his own stone cutting business operating from behind his home at Plunkett O’Boyle Tce on the Back Road.

As the business grew, John’s two sons Tommy and Hugo got involved and soon the business moved to bigger premises at Ballymacool.

Throughout the early days of the 60’s and 70’s Limestone and Marble were the mainstay material used in the Headstone industry which gave way to harder stone mainly granite.

It was then that the Daly yard was equipped with more modern machinery with the installation of larger saws and polishing machines and because of this the business had to move a to a location on Pearse Road and then to Tullygay, Conwall where the new workshop was built in 2005 to suit the demands of the ever changing trade.

Much of the skill needed is now in the technical area with computers taking on much of the lettering and carving work, however we at John Daly & Sons still attain the skill to carve and sculpt by hand.

As the stone trade changes, we will continue to evolve and supply the highest quality memorials and service to our customers here and abroad.
